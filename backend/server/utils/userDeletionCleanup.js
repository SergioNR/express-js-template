//* Shared by self-, team- and admin-triggered deletion:
//* 1. one DB transaction removes the user, revokes their sessions and - when
//*    they were the last member - removes the company's subscription,
//*    invites, files and company rows (see deleteUserWithCompanyDataInDb)
//* 2. after the commit, the Stripe subscription is cancelled at period end
//*    and the company's bucket objects are deleted
//* DB errors (e.g. P2003) propagate from step 1 only - step 2 never throws,
//* so callers can map DB errors without misreporting a committed delete.
//* Resolves to the model's result ({ status, ... })
