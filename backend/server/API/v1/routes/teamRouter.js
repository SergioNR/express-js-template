 *     description: Returns the caller's id, the company members (with their company roles), the pending invites, the caller's effective permissions and the roles the caller can assign. Each member and invite carries a `manageable` flag that mirrors the server-side rules - a member is manageable when the caller outranks every company role the member holds and the member is not the caller; an invite is manageable (resend/revoke) when the caller can grant its role. The write endpoints re-check both. Requires the `team.view` company permission.
