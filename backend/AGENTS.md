# Backend rules — Express.js API

Rules describe how this codebase is written today. Follow them for all new and modified code.

## Stack & runtime

- Node.js >= 26, ESM only (`"type": "module"`), plain `.js` executed via `tsx`.
- ESLint 10 flat config (`eslint.config.mjs`) extending `airbnb-base`: 2-space indent, single quotes, semicolons, trailing commas. Run `npx eslint .` from `backend/`.
- TypeScript is used only for Prisma config (`prisma.config.ts`) and the generated client; server code stays `.js`.

## Architecture — layer rules (strict)

Request flow: `server/app.js` → middlewares → routers → controllers → models/integrations.

- `server/API/v1/routes/` — route definitions only. Middleware chain per route: `authLimiter` (credential endpoints) → `checkSchema(...)` → `sanitizerResult` → controller. No business logic, no Prisma, no third-party calls in routers.
- `server/controllers/` — request handlers. Own status codes and response bodies. Call models and integrations. Throw unexpected errors (Express 5 forwards async throws to the global error handler).
- `server/models/` — ALL database access lives here (repository pattern), one file per resource. Naming: `<verb><Resource>InDb` (e.g. `getUserByEmail`, `deleteUserInDb`). Controllers never import `prisma` directly.
- `server/integrations/` — third-party API calls only (`stripe/`, `brevo/`, `telegram/`), one folder per vendor. Never touch the database.
- `server/middlewares/` — one middleware per file, named export matching the file name. Factories return the handler: `checkAuthentication()`, `checkPermissionByRole(role)`.
- `server/utils/` — cross-cutting helpers (`userDeletionCleanup.js`) and `utils/validators/` with one express-validator schema file per request shape.
- `server/config/` — shared singletons and constants (`prismaClient.js`, `stripe.js`, `logger.js`, `planPrices.js`, `security.js`). No request handling.
- `server/cron/` — `CronJob` instances, started from `cron/jobsContainer.js` (registered in `app.js` via `startCronJobs()`). Errors inside the tick are caught and `logError`-ed, never thrown.
- `server/webhooks/` — inbound webhooks; raw-body only (see Security).
- `server/auth/` — Passport setup; strategies in `auth/strategies/`.

## API conventions

- All API routes are versioned under `/api/v1` and mounted in `server/API/apiRouter.js`. Health check lives in `server/routers/indexRouter.js`.
- **Role enforcement happens at the router mounting level** in `apiRouter.js` (`checkAuthentication()` + `checkPermissionByRole(role)`), not per-route. Exception: `authRouter` gates its private routes mid-file with `authRouter.use(checkAuthentication())` after the public ones.
- **Every route requires an `@openapi` JSDoc block directly above its definition.** swagger-jsdoc scans `server/routers/indexRouter.js`, `server/API/v1/routes/*.js`, `server/webhooks/webhooksRouter.js`. Reuse shared response schemas via `$ref: '#/components/schemas/...'` (defined in `server/config/swagger.js`); add new shared schemas there.
- Response body is the payload itself — the HTTP status alone carries success/failure (no `success` flag). `message` is optional, English, developer-facing (API consumers/logs), present only when it adds info beyond status + payload (conflict reasons, token expiry, rate-limit, route-404, 500). `code` is optional, stable, machine-readable, only where one status covers multiple SPA-distinguishable cases (see `updateUserPassword`). Never rely on `message` wording.
- Every router ends with the `/*fallback` 404 handler (copy the exact shape from `userRouter.js`).
- Status codes: 200 success · 201 created · 400 bad/expired input · 401 unauthenticated · 403 wrong role · 404 not found · 409 conflict (duplicate, self-delete, FK constraint) · 422 validation (`sanitizerResult`) · 429 rate limited · 500 internal only via thrown errors.
- Map Prisma error codes where users interact: `P2002` (unique) → duplicate-safe response; `P2003` (FK) → 409. See `registerUser` and `deleteOneUserById` for the pattern.
- Pagination is cursor-based (`limit` capped at 100 + `cursor` + `nextCursor` in the response), `created_at desc` ordering. See `getAllUsers`.

## Security rules (non-negotiable — outcomes of past audits)

- **Enumeration-safe auth**: `register`, `password-reset` and the team invite create/resend endpoints return an identical response shape and status whether or not the invited/registered account exists, and respond before doing account-dependent work (lookup/create/email run detached) so timing doesn't leak either. Never leak account existence - not even to authenticated callers.
- **Timing-equalized login**: nonexistent users are compared against `DUMMY_PASSWORD_HASH` (`auth/strategies/passportLocalStrategy.js`). Keep it.
- **CSRF / request shape**: state-changing requests must carry an allowlisted `Origin` (fallback `Referer`) — `middlewares/originChecker.js`, allowlist shared with CORS in `config/allowedOrigins.js` (localhost origins only when `DEPLOY_ENVIRONMENT=localhost`). `/api` bodies must be `application/json` (`jsonContentTypeChecker.js`, 415). Never re-add `express.urlencoded`. `/webhooks` and docs mount before these checks and the global limiter.
- **Secret tokens** (invite, password reset): `crypto.randomBytes(32)` base64url via `utils/secureToken.js`; store only the SHA-256 in `token_hash`, send the raw token only by email, never return it in an API response. Row `id` is a public handle. Consume tokens inside a `$transaction` (conditional `deleteMany`, require `count === 1`).
- **Atomic invariants**: checks that guard a write (last company owner, caller outranks every role the target holds) run in the same `$transaction` as the write, with the company row locked (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`) and the caller's role rows re-read under that lock (`callerId` option of `deleteUserWithCompanyDataInDb` / `updateCompanyMemberRoleInDb`) - never pass pre-computed role lists into the transaction. Granting a role (invite, assign) is "at or below own rank" (`canGrantRole`); managing an existing member (remove, change role) is strict - the caller must outrank every role the target holds (`outranksAllRoles`), so peers never touch each other. Removing or demoting a member voids the invites they issued to roles they can no longer grant, and accepting an invite re-checks that the inviter is still a member who can grant it. Deletion cleanup does all DB steps in one transaction and calls Stripe/S3 only after commit.
- **Fire-and-forget side effects**: emails (Brevo), PostHog events, and `last_login_at` updates must not change the response's shape or timing — the integration/model function swallows its own errors and is called without `await`.
- **Stripe webhook**: raw body (`express.raw`) — never mount `express.json()` in front of `/webhooks`. DB writes inside the handler are `await`-ed so failures return 500 and Stripe retries.
- **Redaction**: sensitive fields are redacted in two places — `sanitizerResult.js` (`sensitiveFields`) and `logger.js` pino `redact.paths`. Update both when adding a sensitive field. Never log passwords or reset tokens.
- **Never expose internal Stripe ids**: client-facing subscription reads go through `getSubscriptionPublicDataInDb`.
- **Passwords**: bcrypt with `BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS` (12) from `config/security.js`. Queries returning users must `omit: { password: true }` (only `getUserPassword` selects it).
- **Query whitelist**: never pass `req.query`/`req.body` through to Prisma — whitelist explicit fields (see `getAllUsers` role filter).
- **Admin self-protection**: superadmins cannot delete their own account via `/api/v1/admin` (409) — route them to the user endpoint.
- **Required env vars fail fast at startup** via `requireEnv(name, reason)` from `config/requiredEnv.js` — throws outside localhost, only warns on `DEPLOY_ENVIRONMENT=localhost` so local dev boots with any key unset. `TRUST_PROXY` and `FRONT_WEB_APP_ORIGIN_URL` are required outside localhost; never hard-code `trust proxy`.
- New env vars must be added to `.env.example` and the README table in the same change.

## Validation

- One express-validator schema per request shape in `server/utils/validators/`, mounted as `checkSchema(...)` followed by `sanitizerResult` (rejects with 422 before any controller runs).
- Login, register, invite-accept and the password-reset check/submit (GET/PATCH) routes share the `authLimiter` budget (10 req / 15 min per IP). Login additionally has `loginAccountLimiter` (5 failed attempts / 15 min per normalized username **+ client IP** - the IP in the key keeps an attacker from locking a victim out of their own account by exhausting the budget from elsewhere). The password-reset request route gets its own `passwordResetLimiter` (5 req / 1 hour per IP) so reset emails are throttled independently of login failures. Global limiter (100 req / 15 min) + capped slow-down apply everywhere except local dev, `/webhooks` and docs. Limiters are in-memory per process.
- Don't `escape` emails, passwords or filenames in validators — it corrupts stored data (`o'brien@x.com`); escape on output instead.

## Sessions & auth

- **Two independent role layers — never mix them.**
  - Platform role `User.role` (`UserRoles` enum): `user` for every tenant account, `superadmin` for SaaS-provider staff. Gates routers via `checkPermissionByRole` (superadmin passes every gate) and unlocks `/api/v1/admin`.
  - Company role (`Role` / `UserRole`): `company_owner` > `company_admin` > `company_member`, hierarchy in `utils/companyRoleHierarchy.js`. Company permissions come **only** from company roles — `checkCompanyPermission` and the team controller give superadmins no bypass.
  - Superadmins have `company_id = null` and no company roles. Billing, team and files routers are mounted behind `checkCompanyMembership()` (403 `COMPANY_MEMBERSHIP_REQUIRED`). Code reading `req.user.company_id` must never run for a user without a company; never query `where: { company_id: null }` (it matches every superadmin).
- Passport local strategy; sessions stored in PostgreSQL (Prisma session store), cookie `app.sid` (`SESSION_COOKIE_NAME`), 24h, `secure` + `SameSite=None` outside `DEPLOY_ENVIRONMENT=localhost`.
- Session rows carry `user_id` so sessions are revocable per user (`sessionModel.js`). Password reset and password update revoke sessions inside the same `$transaction` as the credential write (`deleteUserSessionsInTx(tx, userId, keepSessionId?)` and `deleteUserPasswordResetTokensInTx(tx, userId)`); the standalone `deleteUserSessions` throws on failure - never swallow a revocation error.
- Shared deletion side effects (session revoke, company/subscription cleanup) live in `server/utils/userDeletionCleanup.js`, used by both self- and admin-delete.

## Database (Prisma 7)

- Schema: `prisma/schema.prisma`. Models PascalCase, columns snake_case. Generated client outputs to `server/config/generated/` (gitignored + eslint-ignored) — run `npx prisma generate` after schema changes; never edit or commit generated files.
- Runtime client uses the `pg` driver adapter (`server/config/prismaClient.js` → `PRISMA_POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING`); migrations use the direct URL (`prisma.config.ts` → `PRISMA_POSTGRES_DIRECT_URL`).
- Schema changes require: migration (`npx prisma migrate dev --name <change>`), `prisma/seed.js` update if models change, `.env.example`/README if new vars.
- Seed creates 1 company (`Acme Corp`, 7-day trial subscription) + 4 users, password `Password123!`: `owner@acme.test` (platform `user`, `company_owner`), `admin@acme.test` (platform `user`, `company_admin`), `user@acme.test` (platform `user`, `company_member`) and `superadmin@platform.test` (platform `superadmin`, no company, no company role). A `CHECK` constraint on `User` (`20261021160000_detach_superadmins`) enforces `role <> 'superadmin' OR company_id IS NULL`.
- Onboarding: `POST /auth/register` (`username`, `password`, optional `companyName` — kept optional for older clients) creates the company, its trial and the user in one nested write; the registrant is the company's first user and gets `company_owner`. Everyone else joins through team invites.
- Historical quirk: the login/register request field for email is named `username` (validators, controllers, and OpenAPI schema all use it). Keep it consistent; do not rename casually.

## Logging

- Use `logInfo` / `logWarn` / `logError` from `config/loggerFunctions.js` (pino + Telegram). No `console.log` in server code (only `app.js` startup lines with `eslint-disable`).
- Explanatory "why" comments use the `//*` prefix — follow it for rationale comments.

## Testing

- Jest, ESM mode (`NODE_OPTIONS='--experimental-vm-modules' jest`). Specs in `backend/tests/*.spec.js`, named `<unit>.spec.js`.
- Always `import { jest } from '@jest/globals'`. Mock modules with `jest.unstable_mockModule(...)` + top-level `await import(...)` (see `userDeletionCleanup.spec.js`).
- Unit tests are pure — mock the models/integrations; no database or network in tests.
- Add a spec when introducing non-trivial logic (middleware, utils, controllers with branching).

## Docker & deployment

- Prod image: `Dockerfile` (node:26.12-alpine, `tini` as PID 1, non-root, `HEALTHCHECK` against `GET /health`; `start.sh` runs `prisma migrate deploy` then `exec node --import tsx ./server/app.js` - keep its flags in sync with the `start` script). `prisma generate` runs at build time without a database: `prisma.config.ts` falls back to a placeholder URL when `PRISMA_POSTGRES_DIRECT_URL` is unset.
- Local: `docker compose up -d --wait database` (Postgres only, with a `pg_isready` healthcheck; there is no server service, dev Dockerfile or `start:docker` script - the API runs on the host) → `npx prisma migrate deploy` → `npm run start:local`.
- CI (`.github/workflows/docker-build-push.yaml`): a `test` job (backend `npm test` + `npx eslint .`, frontend `npx eslint .` + `npm run build`) gates both image jobs; images are pushed on `latest` / `next` branch pushes, tagged with the branch, branch-date and short commit SHA. `DEPLOY_ENVIRONMENT` (`localhost` | else) toggles rate limiters, cookie strictness and pretty-printed logs.
