## Overview
The API is structured using Express.js and is organized into different modules, primarily focusing on user-related functionalities and Stripe webhook handling. The API is designed to handle various routes and manage user data effectively.

## File Structure
1. **API/readme.md**: Currently empty, intended for documentation.
2. **API/v1/userApiController.mjs**: Contains user-related API routes.
3. **API/apiRouter.mjs**: Main router that integrates different API modules.
4. **API/v1/testApiController.mjs**: Handles Stripe webhook events.

## Key Components

### 1. User API Controller (`userApiController.mjs`)
- **Router Initialization**: The user API is initialized using Express Router.
- **Commented Routes**: There are commented-out sections indicating potential routes for user data retrieval, such as getting user profiles by `userId`.

### 2. Main API Router (`apiRouter.mjs`)
- **Imports**: Integrates user API and Stripe webhook functionalities.
- **Route Definitions**:
  - `POST /v1/test/stripeWebhook`: Endpoint for handling Stripe webhook events.
  - `USE /v1/user`: Mounts the user API routes.
  - **404 Handler**: A catch-all route that returns a 404 status for undefined routes.

### 3. Stripe API Controller (`testApiController.mjs`)
- **Webhook Handling**: The `stripeWebhook` function processes incoming webhook events from Stripe.
- **Event Handling**:
  - Specifically handles the `checkout.session.completed` event.
  - Updates test payment status, requester email, and last updated date based on the event data.
  - Logs unhandled event types for debugging.

## Potential Improvements
- **Documentation**: The `readme.md` file should be populated with API usage instructions, endpoint descriptions, and examples.
- **Error Handling**: Implement more robust error handling in the webhook processing to manage unexpected scenarios.
- **Testing**: Ensure that unit tests are in place for each API endpoint to validate functionality and reliability.
