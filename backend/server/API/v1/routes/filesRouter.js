 *     description: Validates the declared file metadata (size, MIME whitelist - HTML/SVG/XML are never accepted), creates a `pending` file catalog entry and returns a short-lived presigned PUT URL. The client uploads the bytes directly to the bucket with the exact declared `Content-Type` and `Content-Length` (both are signed), then calls `POST /api/v1/files/{fileId}/confirm`. Pending files are not listed nor downloadable, and pending entries older than one hour are deleted automatically together with their object. A company may hold at most 20 unconfirmed uploads at once (409, code `FILE_PENDING_UPLOAD_LIMIT`). Requires the `files.upload` company permission.
